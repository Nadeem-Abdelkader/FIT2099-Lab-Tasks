Advantages of using numeric integer over Java string:
    - More efficient to store info as an integer
    - Easier to sort
    - Easier to perform arithmetic expressions on them.

Advantages of using Java string over numeric integer:
    - Can contain any type of characters (e.g. "A-15707301")
    - If a studentID starts with 0 (e.g. 030146), it will preserve it. Unlike integer data type which will discard any leading 0 (030146 --> 30146)

The final decision is to use Java string because:
    - Were working with a very small amount of information, so efficiency isn't a problem.
    - Probably, won't need to sort by studentID, instead if sorting is necessary were most likely going to opt to sort by name.
    - Not planning on to perform arithmetic operations on studentID.
    - studentID may need to contain letters or special characters (maybe if a student still doesn't know his ID and opts to use his passport number which contains letters)
    - Avoid disregarding leading zeros because they're part of the studentID.

Using ArrayList instead of array beacuse array has fixed size, so we wont be able to add more students if necessary.
